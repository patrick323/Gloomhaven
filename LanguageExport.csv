COMPENDIUM_ActiveBonuses_1,"Some card actions may contain an active bonus effect that applies until either the end of the round or a condition is met. These cards appear at the top of your hand until the effect runs out. The active bonus' card is then discarded or burned depending on the icon at the bottom right-hand corner of the action as usual.

While an active bonus is in effect, there will be an entry alongside the character portrait in the initiative tracker at the top of the screen.

The icons that denote active bonuses are as follows:"
COMPENDIUM_ActiveBonuses_2,"<b>Round Bonus</b>
This icon within an action indicates that the effect applies only until the end of the current round."
COMPENDIUM_ActiveBonuses_3,"<b>Persistent Bonus</b>
This icon within an action indicates that the effect applies until the accompanying condition is met (if no condition is specified, then it lasts until the end of the scenario!) Some persistent bonuses are accompanied by an XP tracker indicating that XP is gained at certain instances of the condition being met, which can be checked in the initiative bar entry for the bonus. "

Some actions can also have these effects as a standalone ability without an attack, and in such cases the target of the effect is written on the ability card.
"
COMPENDIUM_AttackEffects_2,"<b>PUSH X:</b> The target is forced to move X hexes in a direction specified by the attacker, but each hex moved must place the target farther away from the attacker than it was previously. If there are no viable hexes into which to push the target, the push ends. The target can be pushed through its allies, but not its enemies.
"
COMPENDIUM_AttackEffects_3,"<b>PULL X:</b> The target is forced to move X hexes in a direction specified by the attacker, but each hex moved must place the target closer to the attacker than it was previously. If there are no viable hexes into which to pull the target, the pull ends. The target can be pulled through its allies, but not its enemies.
"
COMPENDIUM_AttackEffects_4,"<b>PIERCE X:</b> Up to X points of the target’s Shield are ignored for the attack. Unlike other effects, pierce is applied while calculating the accompanying attack damage instead of afterwards.
"
COMPENDIUM_AttackEffects_5,"<b>ADD TARGET:</b> If a figure triggers this effect with an attack action, the figure may add an additional target within range to their attack. All added effects and conditions of the attack action are applied to the target as well, except for effects that would result in additional targets outside of the original added target."
COMPENDIUM_AttackEffects_Title,Attack Effects
COMPENDIUM_AttackModifiers_1,"When attacking, the base attack value written on the card can be modified by three types of values in the following order. These steps are repeated for each individual enemy targeted by the attack:

• An attacker’s attack modifiers are applied first. These modifiers include bonuses and penalties from active ability cards, items, and other sources (e.g., +1 Attack from Poison).

• Next, an attack modifier card is drawn from the attacker’s attack modifier deck and applied. This appears above the attack recipient's health bar as the attack is happening. The attack modifier cards can be seen by hovering over a character to show their information panel, with the blips next to each modifier showing how many remain in the deck. The deck is reshuffled when the standard <b><color=#A050E0>x0</color></b> or <b><color=#D92727>x2</color></b> cards are drawn."
COMPENDIUM_AttackModifiers_2,"• Lastly, the defender’s defensive bonuses are applied. This reduces the incoming attack value for each individual enemy targeted based on each defender’s own shield modifier or other defensive bonuses.

• Note that because the bonuses are applied per target, it is possible for the same attack action to ultimately deal different damage to each enemy it targets."

COMPENDIUM_BlessAndCurse_1,"Curse and Bless differ from normal conditions in that rather than applying a continuous effect, they add modifiers to the target's modifiers deck."

Each player character ability card has a unique title.

<b>2. Initiative

</b>
The initiative of the first card chosen determines when the character will act in the round.

<b>3. Actions</b>
Each card half represents an action that can be selected to use for the turn, with each action comprising of one or more abilities (e.g. Move, Attack, etc.) Of the two cards selected for a character's turn, one action must be selected from one card, and then the opposite action on the other card. 

<b>4. Default Actions
</b>
In addition to the main action on each card half, all ability cards have basic default actions that can be used instead. The default actions are the same for all cards; <b>Attack 2</b> for the top action, and <b>Move 2</b> for the bottom action."

A consume is represented by one or two elemental symbols each accompanied by an arrow before a colon and an augmentation or ability, indicating the consumption of those elements is the cost to be paid to yield the effect after the colon."
COMPENDIUM_ConsumingElements_2,"If an element is consumed this way it is made inert and removed from the element tracker, regardless of whether it was Strong or Waning. 

For player characters, use of consumes is optional. They can be toggled on or off at any point before the action is carried out by clicking on the element icon(s) of the consume within the action, provided each element required is available. In the case of Any element, you will be prompted to select one from those available. 

Monsters always consume elements for their actions if they can - in the case of Any element they select one from those available at random."

COMPENDIUM_Exhaustion,"A character can become exhausted in one of two ways:

<indent=15>• If a character ever drops below one hit point.

• If, at the beginning of a round, a player cannot play two cards from his or her hand (because they have one or fewer cards in hand) and also cannot rest (because they have one or fewer discarded cards). Exhaustion due to insufficient cards does not affect a character’s current hit point total.

In either case, the character is removed from the scenario, and can no longer participate in the scenario in any way. There is no coming back from being exhausted during a scenario, and thus it should be avoided at all costs. If all characters become exhausted during a scenario, the scenario is lost. It is therefore recommended that you try to not let this happen!"
COMPENDIUM_Exhaustion_Title,Exhaustion
COMPENDIUM_GainingExperience_1,"Some ability card's actions have an experience value attached to them indicated by the shield icon with a number within, where the number is the amount of XP to be granted upon use of the action. A character must use one or more of the abilities in an action to earn experience this way.
"
COMPENDIUM_GainingExperience_2,"Sometimes the action's text specifies that experience is only earned by consuming an elemental infusion by having it as part of the on-consume effect, or only if a certain condition is met (e.g. only if the attacked target is adjacent to one or more of the attacker’s allies) Some persistent active bonuses grant experience when a certain instance of that bonus' trigger condition is reached, as denoted by their accompanying tracker. (See <b>Active Bonuses</b>)

Additionally in Adventure Mode, at the end of each adventure, each character in the party will gain experience based on the adventure difficulty. More difficult adventures will award you more experience, but beware - if you fail an adventure, you will lose all progress since the last village!"

COMPENDIUM_InfusingElements_2,"The circles on the right-hand side of the screen indicate the state of elements. Infused elements in the Strong or Waning state can be consumed to add additional effects and abilities to actions. (See <b>Consuming Elements</b>) 

When an action with an elemental infusion is used, the element will appear in the element tracker in its Infusing state. Only at the end of the turn will the element infuse fully into the Strong state. As such, it is not possible to infuse an element and then consume it within the same character's turn - but may be consumed by anyone later in the initiative order of the same round. At the end of the round, Strong elements become Waning, and Waning elements become inert and are no longer available to consume."

COMPENDIUM_Initiative_1,"Initiative determines the turn order for the player characters and monsters.

The first card you select of the two for the round determines the character's initiative for their turn - the lower the initiative, the earlier the character will be able to act in the turn. You can alternatively opt to use your second card’s initiative by clicking its golden initiative circle."
COMPENDIUM_Initiative_2,"At the point of player character ability card selection, it is not yet known what ability cards the monsters will draw for the turn. As such, you must try to evaluate whether you'd like a particular character to act early or late in a turn without knowledge of what the monsters will do and when! 

Once all player characters and monsters have selected their cards for the turn, initiative track at the top of the screen is updated and ordered accordingly - going from lowest initiatives taking their turns first and highest last.

COMPENDIUM_MeleeAndRanged_1,"An <b>Attack X</b> ability allows a character to do a base X amount of damage to an enemy within their range. Characters and monsters cannot attack their allies. There are two types of attacks, Melee and Ranged:"
COMPENDIUM_MeleeAndRanged_2,"Melee attacks have no accompanying range value and are considered to have a default range of one hex, which means they typically target adjacent enemies."
COMPENDIUM_MeleeAndRanged_3,"Ranged attacks are accompanied by a <b>Range Y</b> value, which means any enemy within Y hexes can be targeted by the attack. Any ranged attack targeting an adjacent enemy gains Disadvantage against that target. (See <b>Advantage and Disadvantage</b>)"
COMPENDIUM_MeleeAndRanged_4,"All ranged and melee attacks can only be performed against enemies within line-of-sight, which means that a line can be drawn from any corner of the attacker’s hex to any corner of the defender’s hex without touching any part of a wall. Only walls block line-of-sight. In addition, any ability which specifies a range can only be performed on a figure within line-of-sight. If a non-attack ability does not specify a range, then line-of-sight is not required. Also note that two hexes separated by a wall line are not considered adjacent, and range cannot be counted through walls."

COMPENDIUM_MonsterAttacks,"A monster will attack on its turn if an <b>Attack</b> ability is part of its drawn card for the round. Any damage dealt is calculated from the attack value present on the ability.

Monsters will always attack their focused enemies but if the monster can attack multiple targets, it will attack its focused enemy and as many other enemies as possible to maximum effect. If a monster has multiple attacks, it will choose the focus of its other attacks following normal focus rules, excluding targets it is already attacking.

Monster attacks function exactly like character attacks, and are modified by the attacker’s attack bonuses, then attack modifier cards, then the defense bonuses of their target, and they may be performed with <b>Advantage</b> or <b>Disadvantage</b>."
COMPENDIUM_MonsterAttacks_Title,Monster Attacks
COMPENDIUM_MonsterFocus,"Before performing the action on their ability card, each individual monster will focus on a specific enemy to it - either a character or character summon.

A monster will focus on the enemy it can perform its current attack against using the least amount of movement. It finds the shortest possible path to get in range and line-of-sight to use its attack, and the enemy that can be attacked at the end of that path is the focus. This enemy is considered the “closest.” It doesn’t matter if the monster can’t get within range to attack with its current movement, as long as there is a path to eventually get within range. 

If a monster does not have an attack listed on its ability card for the round, it finds a focus as if it had a melee attack. In the case where the monster can move the same number of spaces to get within range and line-of-sight of multiple enemies (e.g., because it starts its turn within range of multiple), proximity from the monster’s current position (not counting through walls) is then checked as a tie-breaker for determining “closest.”

If more than one enemy ties for being the closest, the second priority is to focus on the enemy who is earlier in the initiative order (summons are focused on before the character who summoned them in this regard, even on the round they are summoned).

In the case where there are no valid targets on which to focus, because there are no valid hexes a monster can attack from (i.e., they are all blocked, occupied, or there is no open path to reach them), regardless of the number of hexes it could move, a monster will not move or attack on its turn, but it will perform any of the other actions on its ability card that it is able."
COMPENDIUM_MonsterFocus_Title,Monster Focus
COMPENDIUM_MonsterMovement_1,"A monster can move on its turn if a <b>Move</b> is present on its ability card. It can move up to a number of hexes equal to the move value. 

If a monster has a move but no attack afterward as part of its ability card, it will use its movement to get as close as possible to its focused target (determined as if it had a melee attack), moving along the shortest possible path to enter a hex adjacent to its focused enemy.

If a monster has an attack ability after its movement, it will move the least number of hexes possible in such a way as to attack its focused enemy with maximum effect. If it is a single-target melee attack, it will simply move toward the nearest hex adjacent to its focus to attack. If it is a multi-target attack, it will move toward a position where its attack will hit its focused enemy and as many other enemies as possible.

Even if a monster cannot move into attack range, it will still use its movement to get as close as possible to its focus. Having abilities other than <b>Attack</b> on its ability card does not affect a monster’s movement in any way. It will simply move according to the above rules and then use its other abilities as best as it can."
COMPENDIUM_MonsterMovement_2,"If the monster is performing a ranged attack, it will only move toward a hex where it is within range to perform its best possible attack. A monster will also move away from its focused enemy until it can perform the ranged attack without <b>Disadvantage</b>. When forced to choose, a monster will prioritize losing <b>Disadvantage</b> on its focused enemy over maximizing its attack on secondary targets."
COMPENDIUM_MonsterMovement_3,"Even if a monster cannot move into attack range, it will still use its movement to get as close as possible to its focus. Having abilities other than <b>Attack</b> on its ability card does not affect a monster’s movement in any way. It will simply move according to the above rules and then use its other abilities as best as it can."
COMPENDIUM_MonsterMovement_4,"Monsters without the <b>Flying</b> trait consider negative hexes (e.g. ones with traps) to be obstacles when determining focus and movement unless movement through one of these hexes is the only way they can focus on a target. In this case, they will use the path moving through the smallest number of negative hexes possible to find a focus and suffer any consequences."
COMPENDIUM_MonsterMovement_Title,Monster Movement
COMPENDIUM_MonsterTurns,"Monsters’ decisions are controlled by a focus system using action cards to automate what the monsters will do on their turn. All monsters will perform the abilities listed on their drawn card for the round in the order written. They will not move or attack unless these actions are listed on their card.

Monster cards for the round are drawn per monster type, not per monster. This means that all ""Bandit Archers"" for example would all act out the same abilities for each of their turns. 

All elites of a monster type act first, then the normal monsters of that type act. If more than one elite or normal monster of a given type is present on the board, then the monsters act in ascending numerical order. All monsters of the same type take individual turns, not all together, at the same initiative value listed on their drawn monster card for the round."

Traps can be moved through and are triggered when their tile is entered with normal movement. Movement cannot end in the same hex as another character or monster. Walls can never be moved through."
COMPENDIUM_MovementTypes_2,"<b>Jump</b>
Some Move abilities are specified as a <b>Jump</b>. A jump move allows the character to ignore all characters, monsters, obstacles and traps during their movement.

Some monsters may also have the <b>Flying</b> special trait. This allows them to completely ignore any characters, monsters, traps and obstacles during any part of their movement, including the last hex, except that they must still end their movement in an unoccupied hex (no characters or monsters present). This includes forced movement like a Push or Pull.

COMPENDIUM_Summon,"Some abilities summon allies to assist you. Summons are placed in an empty hex adjacent to the character performing the summon. If there are no available hexes, the summon ability cannot be used.

Summons have basic statistics for hit points, attack value, move value, and range value along with any special traits written on the ability card. A summon is considered a persistent bonus (the card is placed in the active area) until either the summon loses all its hit points, its corresponding ability card is removed from the active area, or the summoner becomes exhausted, at which point the summon disappears. 

A summon’s turn in the initiative order is always directly before the character who summoned it, and is separate from that character’s turn. Summons are not controlled by the summoning player, but instead obey automated monster rules, permanently performing <b>Move X, Attack Y</b>, where X and Y are its base move and attack values respectively. Summons use the player’s attack modifier deck to perform its attacks.

A player can have multiple different summon abilities in play at once, in which case they act in the order in which they were summoned. Summoned figures never take a turn in the round they are summoned. Summon kills are credited to the owner of the summon."

Notice that underneath is an option to consume the element Earth (See <b>Elements</b>) to augment this ability to deal two damage instead of one and gain XP. Note that this consume option only applies to the latter instance of damage that directly precedes it on the card.</indent>

• <indent=15>After all three of the abilities are complete, there is 1 XP to be gained from the floating symbol for it within the action, and due to the burned icon in the corner of the card, the card is burned instead of being discarded for choosing this action.</indent>"
COMPENDIUM_UsingAbilites_Title,Using Abilities
COMPENDIUM_UsingItems_1,"The icon to use an item glows to indicate when they can be used, according to the constraints of what is written on the item card. from these equip slots by clicking on them at these times. Note that if an item affects an attack (e.g. adds a bonus, an effect, advantage, or disadvantage), it will only be availble to be used before the attack is committed - i.e. before the attack modifier for the attack is drawn.

If an effect is added to an attack, it functions exactly as if it had been written on the action card being used for the attack. There is no limit to the number of items a character can use on their turn or even during a specific ability, provided the item is still available to be spent. Any instance of applying the effects of an item card to a situation is considered a use.

There are three different things that can happen to an item card after it is used, denoted by the following:"
COMPENDIUM_UsingItems_2,"This symbol means that the item is <b>Spent</b> after use, and cannot be reused in this scenario until it is refreshed, by either a long rest or an ability's effect."
COMPENDIUM_UsingItems_3,"This symbol means that the item is <b>Consumed</b> after use, and can only be refreshed within a scenario by specific abilities. All items are refreshed between scenarios, and no item can be permanently consumed."
COMPENDIUM_UsingItems_4,"If a card depicts neither of these symbols, there a no restrictions on the number of times it can be used during a scenario, other than what is written on the text of the item card."

EVENT_ADaggerintheChest,"The body of an Inox lies slumped against a tree stump up ahead. As you get closer, you notice a dagger protruding from her chest."
EVENT_ADaggerintheChest_A,Remove the dagger
EVENT_ADaggerintheChest_B,Leave her be
EVENT_ADaggerintheChest_DaggerRemoved,The corroded blade breaks off as you try to remove the dagger from her chest. You toss the useless hilt aside and continue down the road.
EVENT_ADaggerintheChest_DaggerRemoved_Gained1,"As you remove the dagger from the Inox you manage to nick yourself on the blade. You are suddenly overcome with a feeling of intense sickness - it would appear that the blade is in fact a Poison Dagger.

You carefully pocket the blade and continue down the road, feeling awful."
EVENT_ADaggerintheChest_DaggerRemoved_Gained2,"You remove the blade from her chest and examine it. The blade has a slight green tinge to it - this blade appears to be a Poison Dagger.

You carefully pocket the blade and continue down the road."
EVENT_ADaggerintheChest_Leave,You leave the body of the Inox be and continue down the road.
EVENT_ADiscardedFlask,"You happen upon a stoppered flask lying in the road, clearly dropped by some clumsy adventurer. You pick up the flask and notice that there is still a good amount inside, and you are feeling a tad thirsty..."
EVENT_ADiscardedFlask_A,Take a drink
EVENT_ADiscardedFlask_B,Leave the flask alone
EVENT_ADiscardedFlask_DrinkDrunk,"The flask merely contains a small amount of refreshing water. You drink your fill and continue down the road, your thirst thoroughly quenched."
EVENT_ADiscardedFlask_DrinkDrunk_Gained1,"You have no idea what it is exactly that you are drinking, but it sure is good!

You share the hearty brew around the party, feeling invigorated as you journey onward."
EVENT_ADiscardedFlask_DrinkDrunk_Gained2,"As you raise the flask to your lips you notice the overpowering stench of strong alcohol, but decide to try nonetheless. Despite your coughing, spluttering and likening of the drink to liquid fire your party members are all too keen to try the strong brew.

With the flask now empty, you all stumble onwards, somewhat inebriated."
EVENT_ADiscardedFlask_Leave,You resist the urge to drink and toss the flask aside. Perhaps random drinks are best left undrunk!
EVENT_AShortcut,"Tired of traversing a tedious route around a dense forest, you contemplate taking a path straight through the maze of branches to shorten your journey time considerably. You notice a slight clearing behind the bushes up ahead that could prove to be a shortcut through the dense forest."
EVENT_AShortcut_A,Try the potential shortcut
EVENT_AShortcut_B,Continue down the road
EVENT_AShortcut_Berries,"The berries are somehow unremarkable in just about every aspect. You rejoin the road without bothering to take any of the bland berries with you, pleased that the shortcut was a success."
EVENT_AShortcut_Berries_Gained1,"The berries not only taste foul, but seem to be poisonous too! Why exactly each and every member of your party decided to try the berries you're not quite sure, but you all feel dreadful as you now rejoin the road, clutching at your stomachs."
EVENT_AShortcut_Berries_Gained2,"The berries not only taste great, but seem to have invigorating properties of some kind - you feel better than you have in months! You fill your pockets to the brim with the delicious berries and rejoin the road."
EVENT_AShortcut_ContinueDownRoad,"After mulling it over, you decide it's perhaps best to continue down the road."
EVENT_AShortcut_TakeTheShortcut,"The clearing continues on through the forest and you are pleased to make it through to the other side. At the forest's edge, you are just about to rejoin the road when you notice a small patch of bushes nearby, adorned with strange purple berries."
EVENT_AShortcut_TakeTheShortcut_A,Try the berries
EVENT_AShortcut_TakeTheShortcut_B,Continue down the road
EVENT_AShortcut_TakeTheShortcut_Gained,"It would seem that you are not the first to have considered this route - deep in some brambles you spot some gear left behind by a previous adventurer! You take it and continue on through the forest clearing, pleased with your find."
EVENT_AbandonedCart,"A cart lies seemingly abandoned by the side of the road; whoever owns it is nowhere to be seen. The back of the cart is mostly loaded with junk, but there is a barrel loaded with food - and you are feeling rather hungry..."
EVENT_AbandonedCart_A,Eat the food
EVENT_AbandonedCart_B,Leave the cart alone
EVENT_AbandonedCart_Eat,"The food is rather stale, and after a few attempted bites at a rock-solid loaf of bread, you toss it aside with a sigh.

You continue down the road, disappointed that you hadn't come across the cart earlier when the food was still edible."
EVENT_AbandonedCart_Eat_Poison,"The food smells slightly odd, but you greedily eat your fill from the barrel nonetheless.

As you turn to leave, your stomach suddenly starts to gurgle and growl loudly. A few moments later, and you find yourself keeled over in the bushes, vomiting profusely.

Perhaps you'll think twice next time before consuming mysteriously abandoned food."
EVENT_AbandonedCart_Eat_Strengthen,"The food in the barrel is far superior to the supplies you brought with you - soft loaves of seeded bread, strips of dry-cured meat, fresh fruits and vegetables - a true feast! You fashion a hearty meal from the barrel's contents and eat your fill.

Feeling invigorated, you continue down the road."
EVENT_AbandonedCart_Leave,"Tempting as the food poking out of the barrel may be, you decide to leave the cart alone lest the owner return and continue down the path."
EVENT_AbandonedCart_Leave2,"As you begin to walk away, there is a sudden rustling of leaves from the bushes by the side of the road. A short, portly man emerges from the bushes, hoisting his breeches when he spots you and jumps slightly in surprise.

""Oh! Well met, fellow travellers,\"" he says, nodding his head in greeting. He looks over at his cart and smiles. \""Thank you for not stealing from my cart while I was... preoccupied. Y'know, I have more food than I could possibly eat back there - you're welcome to join me for a meal.\""

You accept the man's offer and partake in a meal far superior to the meagre supplies you brought with you. You finish your meal and part ways with the kind man, invigorated by the fine meal you consumed."
EVENT_AbandonedCart_Leave_A,Leave
EVENT_AbandonedCart_Leave_Gained,"Tempting as the food poking out of the barrel may be, you decide to leave the cart alone lest the owner return and continue down the path."
EVENT_AmbushAftermath,"There was a massacre here - the bodies of a group of clerics and healers lie strewn across the path. Whoever killed these people appears to be long gone.

They could still have valuables should you choose to loot them, but you also wonder whether the powers that be might smile upon those that would bury them."
EVENT_AmbushAftermath_A,Loot the bodies
EVENT_AmbushAftermath_B,Bury the bodies
EVENT_AmbushAftermath_Bury2,"Somehow you get the feeling that despite your good intentions with burying the dead, the fact you looted them first negates this good deed somewhat."
EVENT_AmbushAftermath_Bury_Bless,"You feel that you have done the right thing in burying these poor souls. Content with your good deed, you journey onward."
EVENT_AmbushAftermath_Bury_Disarm,"Just as you are about to start digging, you hear the snap of a twig underfoot. You look up to find yourself suddenly surrounded by a small group of not-so-long-gone bandits - it's an ambush! There's nowhere to run, you've no choice but to fight them."
EVENT_AmbushAftermath_C,Leave
EVENT_AmbushAftermath_Fight,"Despite being outnumbered and caught off guard by the bandits, it eventually becomes clear to them that you are far tougher than the previous group they ambushed. As they begin to turn tail and run, you notice one of the bandits running off with what little loot there was left from their previous ambush!

Suffering from injuries sustained in the battle, you decide not to stay and find out if the bandits intend to return with reinforcements."
EVENT_AmbushAftermath_Leave,"Whoever killed these people could return at any moment, and you don't quite fancy meeting the same fate - you hurriedly leave the area."
EVENT_AmbushAftermath_Loot,"The corpses have been picked clean already, there is nothing of value left at all."
EVENT_AmbushAftermath_Loot_A,Bury the bodies
EVENT_AmbushAftermath_Loot_B,Leave
EVENT_AmbushAftermath_Loot_Disarm,"As you begin to sift through corpses and their belongings, you hear the snap of a twig underfoot. You look up to find yourself suddenly surrounded by a small group of not-so-long-gone bandits - it's an ambush! There's nowhere to run, you've no choice but to fight them."
EVENT_AmbushAftermath_Loot_Disarm_A,Fight the bandits
EVENT_AmbushAftermath_Loot_Gold,"None of the gear is in good enough condition to be of use, with anything of worth likely having been looted already by whoever killed these people. You do manage to find a small quantity of gold tucked away in the pocket of one of the deceased however!"
EVENT_AmbushAftermath_Loot_Item,"Much of the gear is in too poor a condition to be of use, with anything of worth likely having been looted already. However, you do manage to find one item that could be of use to you that whoever killed these people must have missed!"
EVENT_BrokenCart,"You come across an elderly wine merchant by the side of the road. One of the wheels of his cart has fallen off and you see him struggling to put it back on. He doesn't seem to notice you as you approach, but it is clear he hasn't the strength to lift the cart to replace the wheel by himself."
EVENT_BrokenCart_A,Offer to help the wine merchant
EVENT_BrokenCart_B,Rob the wine merchant
EVENT_BrokenCart_C,Leave
EVENT_BrokenCart_Drink,"The wine is some of the finest you have ever tasted. Feeling invigorated by the fine vintage, you continue down the road."
EVENT_BrokenCart_Drink2,"The wine tastes foul - you spit it out almost immediately. With nothing else of value to take from the merchant, you leave him to deal with the broken wheel by himself and continue down the road."
EVENT_BrokenCart_Drink2_Gained_Muddle,"The wine tastes good, but perhaps a little too good - you all drink far more than you probably should. You stumble away, well and truly intoxicated."
EVENT_BrokenCart_Drink2_Gained_Strengthen,The wine tastes incredible - you all feel invigorated for having consumed such a fine vintage. You leave the merchant to deal with the broken wheel by himself and continue down the road.
EVENT_BrokenCart_Help,"You tap the wine merchant on the shoulder, startling him enough to make him jump into the air.

""GAH! Don't sneak up on an old man like that!""

His beady eyes glance around the party through a pair of dirty, scratched spectacles. Just as you are about to open your mouth to offer assistance, he snaps at you.

""Are you just going to stand there all day? You there, stop gawping and lift the cart up, and you, hold the wheel steady! On the count of three - that is, ON three, NOT after - you're going to lift the wheel and..."
EVENT_BrokenCart_Help2,"You manage to get the wheel back onto the cart without too much difficulty, although as far as the merchant is concerned he ""could've done it much more easily without the help of you buffoons!"" The merchant continues to rant about your ineptitude as he departs without even an uttering a word of thanks.

As you are about to leave, you notice a bottle of wine has fallen off of the cart into the shrubs by the side of the road. With the merchant already some distance down the road, you decide to take it as repayment for your assistance and share it amongst the party."
EVENT_BrokenCart_Help2_Gained,"You manage to get the wheel back onto the cart without too much difficulty, although as far as the merchant is concerned he \""could've done it much more easily without the help of you buffoons!\"" The merchant continues to rant about your ineptitude as he tosses you a handful of coins for your assistance and departs without even an uttering a word of thanks."
EVENT_BrokenCart_Help2_Gained_Next,Next
EVENT_BrokenCart_Help_A,Help the wine merchant
EVENT_BrokenCart_Leave,You decide the merchant's problems are none of your concern and pass him by.
EVENT_BrokenCart_Rob,"The merchant cowers behind his cart as he sees you approach with weapons drawn.

""P-Please don't hurt me!"" he stammered. ""I'll give you what little gold I have, a-and you can take as much wine as you like, just please leave me be!""

With trembling hands he reaches down to his belt, removes a small pouch of coins, and tosses it towards you. ""It's all the gold I've got, I swear!""

You pick it up and pocket the gold before picking up a bottle of wine from the cart."
EVENT_BrokenCart_Rob_A,Drink
EVENT_BucketofLuck,"Up ahead you notice a peculiar-looking man has set up a stall at a fork in the road. As you get closer, you see a large wooden barrel filled to the brim with what appears to be soil. The words 'Bucket o' Luck' are crudely scrawled on the side.

'Welcome, welcome, one and all!' he calls out out to you. 'Fancy trying your luck?'"
EVENT_BucketofLuck_A,Approach the stall
EVENT_BucketofLuck_Approach,"As you approach, you see that the man is covered in a layer of dirt, with it caked under his long, claw-like fingernails. He notices you staring and chuckles. ""Well, I gotta get me prizes from somewhere, don't I?"" he says with a wry smile, before awkwardly winking at you.

""¬LoseSmallGold.GoldAmount¬ of your finest gold pieces to play - who knows what ye might find, eh?"""

EVENT_BucketofLuck_B,Walk on by
EVENT_BucketofLuck_GainedLoot_Gained1,"You feel around inside the barrel for a while, before brushing your hand up against something. You grab it tightly and pull out a pair of leather boots.

""Cor, they've got quite a pong to 'em, don't they?"" He pinches his nose, seemingly oblivious to the fact that he smells far worse than the boots. ""Used to belong to a City Guard, if I remember rightly.""

Looking at the boots, they appear to be well-made from high quality leather, albeit a tad worn. After brushing the dirt off of your arm and the boots, you take your leave."
EVENT_BucketofLuck_GainedLoot_Gained2,"You feel around inside the barrel for a while, before brushing your hand up against something. You grab it tightly and pull out a pair of worn goggles.

""Ah, those things... I could barely see through 'em, truth be told, but I'm sure ye can find more use for 'em than I did.""

Wiping off the dirt and bidding the strange man farewell, you try on the goggles as you continue down the road."
EVENT_BucketofLuck_Leave,You decide you'd rather not stick your hand into a barrel of who-knows-what. You politely refuse the strange man's offer and take your leave.
EVENT_BucketofLuck_PlayBarrel,"You hand over the gold and he pockets it greedily. ""Go on then, stick yer 'and in!""

You dig your arm deep into the barrel, not exactly sure what to expect."
EVENT_BucketofLuck_PlayBarrel_A,...

EVENT_Duel_BreakUp_Gained_Damage,"You leap into their midst in attempt to break up the fight - but at that exact moment the Savvas summons spikes of earth from the ground intended for the Inox.

Despite injuries sustained from the spikes you successfully manage to drag them away from each other, allowing them to calm down.

Without explaining why they were fighting, they each wrest themselves from your grasp and storm off, heading down the path in opposite directions."
EVENT_Duel_BreakUp_Gained_Item,"You leap into their midst in attempt to break up the fight - however, each thinks that you've joined the other's side and they both flee!

EVENT_Duel_HelpSavvas_Gained_Item,"You side with the Savvas, and the Inox flees, seeing he is outnumbered. The Savvas thanks you for your assistance, and hands you a potion before bidding you farewell."
EVENT_Duel_Leave,"You decide not to interfere, and continue down the path, the sounds of their battling fading as you walk away."
EVENT_RopeBridge,"The path leads you to a ravine, with a rickety old rope bridge as the only way across as far as you can see. The ropes look very worn and the wooden planks rather rotten, but looking for another way across looks like it could take quite some time."
EVENT_RopeBridge_A,Cross the rope bridge
EVENT_RopeBridge_AnotherWay,"You're in luck! Not too far along the edge of the ravine you find a large tree has fallen to form a makeshift bridge across thanks to a storm. It appears to be far more sturdy than the rotten rope bridge, so you make your way across without issue."
EVENT_RopeBridge_AnotherWay_Gained,"You walk and walk for the rest of the day and still do not find a way across. As dusk falls you finally find the end of the ravine, allowing you to cross over and make the long walk back to the path on the other side, so exhausted by this unexpected detour that you feel a headache coming on."
EVENT_RopeBridge_B,Try to find another way across

EVENT_RopeBridge_Cross_Lost,"The rope bridge creaks and sways precariously under your weight with each step. You nearly make it across when it suddenly one of the planks snaps and you fall from the bridge!

You just manage to catch one of the ropes that held the plank before you would fall into the ravine - but a small pouch of gold flies from your belt and disappears into the darkness below.

You pull yourself up and cautiously make it the rest of the way to the other side. You breathe a sigh of relief after such a close call and continue with your journey."
EVENT_ShadowsontheWall,"The road you are on leads you to a narrow cliffside path. As the only route in sight to reach the bottom, you begin your descent."
EVENT_ShadowsontheWall_A,Descend
EVENT_ShadowsontheWall_Descent,"You notice the cliff face here is becoming smoother as you descend. Mysterious etchings and carvings start to emerge as you examine the wall. They begin to morph into shadows that swirl and dance about the surface, seemingly leading you along the wall to a spot on the ground.

Tucked into a small alcove at the base of the wall lies an urn, with a small quantity of coins inside."

EVENT_ShadowsontheWall_Take,"The shadows freeze in place as you take the coins from the urn, before taking the loose form of a menacing face which sends a chill down your spine. In the blink of an eye, the shadows and the smooth wall vanish, leaving behind only the rough cliff face with no sign of the urn you took the gold from.

You continue down the path with a bad feeling niggling away at the back of your mind..."

""Hey, you there, travelers! Help a poor Tinkerer out, would you?"""
EVENT_StrungUp_A,Ask him what happened
EVENT_StrungUp_AskHim,"""I was attempting to combine that there Net Shooter and Hook Gun...""

EVENT_The WomanoftheWoods,"As you continue along your path, a old woman steps out of the trees from the side of the path. She is dressed in ragged clothing, and has a rusty necklace around her neck.

EVENT_TheFunGuy,"Walking through a wooded glade, you notice something buried in the undergrowth. Upon closer inspection, you see that it is the body of an Inox face down on the ground, clearly long dead. Mushrooms have begun sprouting in clusters all over the decomposing body, and it is giving off a foul stench.

Looking for anything of value on the corpse, you see that the majority of the Inox's gear is far too rotten to be of any use. His boots, however, appear to be in pristine condition, entirely untouched by the decay."
EVENT_TheFunGuy_A,Take off the boots
EVENT_TheFunGuy_B,Leave the corpse be

EVENT_TheFunGuy_GainedLoot_Gained,"As you remove the boots, large chunks of putrid flesh from the Inox's feet come off with them. A cloud of spores eject from some of the mushrooms disturbed by your removal of the boots and engulf the party.

You are overwhelmed with a feeling of nausea and jump back from the corpse, but it is too late - you are poisoned. You empty out the bits of Inox from the boots and continue through the glade, feeling awful."

You turn just in time to avoid taking a rusty sword to the face courtesy of some Living Bones! The skeletons have risen up from the ground to slay those that would dare disturb their slumber.

You defeat the reanimated remains with several well timed strikes, but not before taking a few hits from their surprise attack.

Unfortunately, their gear is corroded beyond the point of being worth taking, so you resume your search for the path, limping slightly."

EVENT_TheShrine_Large,"You put a generous amount of coins into the slot, and wait...

Nothing seems to happen at first, but you soon feel the warmth of the sun shining down upon you. Filled with a sense of rejuvenation from the sunlight, you turn to continue down the road - when you suddenly notice a potion atop the shrine that you are certain was not there before.

Taking the potion to be a reward for your generosity, you pick it up and journey onwards, pleased that your offering seems to have been appreciated."
EVENT_TheShrine_Leave,You decide not to make an offering and continue on your way.
EVENT_TheShrine_Medium,"You put a fair amount of coins into the slot, and wait...

Nothing seems to happen at first, but you soon feel the warmth of the sun shining down upon you. Filled with a sense of rejuvenation from the sunlight, you continue down the road, pleased that your offering seems to have been appreciated."
EVENT_TheShrine_Small,"You put a meagre amount of coins into the slot, and wait... but nothing happens.

You continue down the road, wondering whether you might have been rewarded had you been more generous."
EVENT_TheShrine_Smash,"The shrine is well made and does not break easily, but it eventually succumbs to your attacks and splits open, spilling coins onto the floor in front of you.

You quickly gather up the coins and continue down the path, noticing a sudden chill in the air that causes you to shudder. You can't help but wonder whether your dishonourable act perhaps did not go unnoticed..."
EVENT_TheStorm,"As you make your way along the path, the clouds darken overhead and it begins to rain. Within moments, you find yourself in the midst of a full blown storm, complete with resounding thunderclaps and flashes of lightning.

You notice through the torrential downpour that the lightning appears to be striking the same spot repeatedly."
EVENT_TheStorm_A,Investigate
EVENT_TheStorm_B,Seek shelter
EVENT_TheStorm_Bridge,"It's cold and muddy under the bridge, but it at least offers you safety from the storm. You look over to the large tree you nearly considered to use as shelter, just as it is struck by lightning and explodes!

You breathe a great sigh of relief for having chosen the sensible option, and reflect upon your experience as you wait out the storm."
EVENT_TheStorm_Investigate,"You approach the spot where the lightning seems to be focused, catching a glimpse of a metallic object protruding from the ground in the flash from a lightning strike. It seems that this object is acting as a lightning rod, attracting the strikes with unusual consistency for something so small - could quite possibly be an artefact with magical properties."
EVENT_TheStorm_Investigate_A,Attempt to take the object
EVENT_TheStorm_Investigate_B,Ignore the item and seek shelter
EVENT_TheStorm_SeekShelter,"Eager to get out of the rain, you see a large tree up ahead which you could use for cover - alternatively you could double back on yourself to a bridge over a muddy creek you saw earlier."
EVENT_TheStorm_SeekShelter_A,Shelter under the tree
EVENT_TheStorm_SeekShelter_B,Shelter under the bridge
EVENT_TheStorm_Take_Gained1,"You wait for a window of opportunity between strikes to approach the object - only to be suddenly struck yourself!

Unwilling to risk further injury, you decide to leave the object alone lest you get struck again."
EVENT_TheStorm_Take_Gained2,"You wait for a window of opportunity between strikes to approach the object, and wrench it from the ground.

As soon as the object leaves the ground, you sense a sudden change in the air pressure around you, and the storm begins to subside. Examining the item closely, it appears to be a ¬TheStorm_Take.Item¬!

Pleased with your find, you journey onwards, as rays of sunlight begin to shine down through the dissipating storm clouds."
EVENT_TheStorm_Take_Gained3,"You wait for a window of opportunity between strikes to approach the object, and wrench it from the ground - but not before getting struck by lightning yourself!

As soon as the object leaves the ground, you sense a sudden change in the air pressure around you, and the storm begins to subside. Examining the item closely, it appears to be a ¬TheStorm_Take.Item¬!

Somewhat singed but nonetheless pleased with your find, you journey onwards, as rays of sunlight begin to shine down through the dissipating storm clouds."
EVENT_TheStorm_Tree,"The branches offer some slight protection from the rain as you wait for the storm to pass - when suddenly, the tree you are under is struck by lightning! The trunk explodes violently, sending splinters and fragments flying in all directions. As if being pelted with bits of burning tree wasn't bad enough, the lightning conducts through the party, leaving you all thoroughly shocked.

In searing pain, you stumble in the direction of the bridge to wait out the storm under, having learned a valuable lesson about not using trees for shelter in a thunderstorm."
EVENT_TollRoad,"The path leads you to a narrow passage between two rocky outcrops. You are about to make your way through when several hooded figures suddenly step out from behind the rocks.

""Halt!""

 The largest of the men steps towards you. ""This here's a toll road,"" the man grunts. ""If you wanna pass, you gotta pay.""

You notice several others have also emerged from the rocks behind you - you're surrounded."

EVENT_TollRoad_C_Unavailable,"Brute: ""Inox do not run."""
EVENT_TollRoad_Fight,"Without hesitation, you take down the bandit leader before his goons can close in on you. Several hacks and slashes later, all of the bandits lie dead on the ground.

You take the coin purse from the bandit leader's belt and continue through the passage."
EVENT_TollRoad_Fight_Gained,"You attempt to take down the bandit leader before he can react, but he is faster than you expect for a man of his stature. He catches you with a wide horizontal slash with his dagger, before falling after a blow to the head. Injured but undaunted, you turn to take on the rest of his goons.

Clearly no match for the likes of you, within seconds they all lie dead on the ground. You claim the coin purse from the bandit leader's belt as a prize and continue through the passage."
EVENT_TollRoad_Flee,"You dash back along the path, knocking over a pair of bandits as you make your escape. A few of the bandits attempt to give chase, but you quickly lose them in the dense forest.

After a long detour through the forest, you eventually rejoin the path, well beyond where you encountered the bandits."
EVENT_TollRoad_Flee_Gained1,"You dash back along the path, knocking over a pair of bandits as you make your escape. As you barge into one of them, you manage to knock his weapon from his hand and catch it.

You nearly reach the treeline unscathed when you are hit in the back by several arrows from the bandit archers. A few of the bandits attempt to give chase, but despite your wounds you quickly lose them in the dense forest.

After a long detour through the forest, you eventually rejoin the path, well beyond where you encountered the bandits."
EVENT_TollRoad_Flee_Gained2,"You dash back along the path, knocking over a pair of bandits as you make your escape. You nearly reach the treeline unscathed when you are hit in the back by several arrows from the bandit archers.

A few of the bandits attempt to give chase, but despite your wounds you quickly lose them in the dense forest.

After a long detour through the forest, you eventually rejoin the path, well beyond where you encountered the bandits."
EVENT_TollRoad_Pay,"You begrudgingly hand over the gold, not wanting any trouble. ""Thank you kindly,"" the man says with a grin, stepping aside to let you pass.

You awkwardly make your way past the bandits and through the passage, trying to ignore their sneering and derisive laughter as you leave."

GUI_ADV_TUTORIAL_CULTIST_TITLE,And so to the Spoils...?
GUI_ADV_TUTORIAL_FINISH,"With the rotting corpse of the Bandit Commander smelling even worse than the last time you killed him, you look around this damp and empty Tomb. You realise, somewhat too late, that perhaps the best time to pick profitable adventures isn’t while you are drunk in a pub.

But gold and trinkets aren’t as important as making the world a safer place for the common folk, is it? You may not be rich, but you can call yourselves Heroes, and maybe next time you want a drink, someone else might actually offer to pay for it.

SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2A_01,"Welcome to your first training Scenario. In this case, we are dealing with another <b>Bandit</b>, but be careful, she’s an <b>Elite</b>!"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2A_02,"That means she has higher health than normal, and the <b>Brute</b> has taken a bit of a battering and is down to 1 <b>Health</b>!"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2A_03,Your initial <b>Objective</b> is kill the <b>Elite Archer</b> and then <b>Loot</b> the Gold Coins she drops on the First Turn. Let me see what you have learned so far!
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2A_04,"Whoops. You only had 1 <b>Health</b> which means you can’t afford to take any more damage, try again, but this time choose to <b>Burn</b> one of your <b>Active</b> cards this time."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2A_05,"Nice work on not dying, but the <b>Objective</b> was also to kill the <b>Elite Archer</b>. Is there an ability you could use that will do 6 damage in one go? Have another go."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2A_06,"I knew you could do it! <b>Overwhelming Assault</b> is a great card, but now it’s been <b>Burned</b>, so you can’t use it again this scenario, along with the card you used to prevent the incoming damage."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2A_07,"The dungeon is now empty of enemies, but we can’t just leave that chest sitting over there, here’s one <b>Final Objective</b>, <b>Loot</b> the <b>Chest</b>."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2A_08,"It may sound easy, but you only have 1 <b>Health</b> remaining, not enough <b>Active</b> cards for the turn, and there is a <b>Trap</b> in the way, good luck!"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2A_09,"Ouch! A <b>Short Rest</b> is great when you quickly need some cards to survive a round, but when you have some time a <b>Long Rest</b> also <b>Heals</b> you a little, try that next time."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2A_10,"We’re not leaving here until you grab what is in that <b>Chest</b>, looks like you need to step on that <b>Trap</b>. Try Again.
"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2A_11,"Ooh, a <b>Boots of Striding</b>, that’ll come in handy the next time you are under attack. I think we should work a bit more on <b>Traps</b> first, Onwards we go!"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2B_01,This time we face an <b>Archer</b> who fires at long range and our Brutish friend is well out of melee range and on the other side of a <b>Trap</b>.
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2B_02,There are a couple of new things to bear in mind...
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2B_03,"Firstly, if a <b>Move</b> action has the <b>Jump</b> modifier, you are able to cross tiles with <b>Obstacles</b> or <b>Traps</b> without penalty."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2B_04,"Secondly, those <b>Boots</b> we picked up in the last mission can be used to boost a <b>Move</b> action by 2 hexes."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2B_05,"Be aware that <b>Archers</b> can act pretty quickly, so get the first hit in, you never know your luck, it might be enough to take her down!"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2B_06,"She’s very quick and has got a long range on that bow, so you need to move quickly and get up close and personal, the <b>Boots</b> will help!"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2B_07,"The key here is to get across that <b>Trap</b>, and to do that you’ll need a <b>Move</b> with the <b>Jump</b> modifier to avoid the damage."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2B_08,"You did it! Not only did you get a decent hit in, but you may have noticed a blue effect hit the <b>Archer</b> too."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2B_09,"<b>Provoking Roar’s</b> attack action comes with a <b>Disarm Effect</b>, and that means the <b>Archer</b> couldn’t attack for a turn. Of course, you knew that already."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2B_10,"She’s looking pretty low on <b>Health</b> now, so time to finish her off, and again, to succeed on this mission, we should get open that <b>Chest</b> too!"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2B_11,"You need to get in a quick attack again, make sure the first ability you choose is one with a low <b>Initiative</b>."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2B_12,"You’ll need to <b>Loot</b> that <b>Chest</b>, or it isn’t a true victory."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2B_13,"I know you already know how to <b>Jump</b>, so you need to get that <b>Discarded</b> card back into your hand, remember how?."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2B_14,"Nice work, a <b>Short Rest</b>, solid stab and a <b>Jump</b> onto the <b>Chest</b>, you are getting the hang of this mercenary lark."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2B_15,"Look, we’ve also got a <b>Healing Potion</b>, that should help later."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2C_01,"To be a successful mercenary, you need to second guess your adversaries and respond to their actions."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2C_02,This training mission will test your ability to do both.
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2C_03,"Your objective sounds simple enough, ‘Don’t Get Attacked’, so you’ll need to try again if anyone gets a bead on you!"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2C_04,"My Advice? Act quickly, and take a careful note of what the enemies are going to do, only then can you manage to avoid them!"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2C_05,"You need to move fast and avoid a radius of 3 hexes around the Archer, not just the melee range, have another go."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2C_06,"You made it to the 2nd room, good work! Remember that newly revealed enemies still get their go this turn. Is there a spot where the Guard can’t reach you from?"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2C_07,"Nice work, both avoiding the attackers in the first room and not running into the guy in the second room!"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2C_08,"This would be a pretty grim situation to find yourself in the main game, but fortunately, you just need to do the same as last turn, Don’t get attacked!"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2C_09,"You’ll find it a lot harder to find a safe space this time, so maybe you need to prevent an attack a different way?"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2C_10,"You need to keep ahead of those Archer by moving further into the room, but how to stop the Guard attacking you instead?"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2C_11,"You avoided the Archer, good job!"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2C_12,"You didn’t avoid the Guard, less good… I’m sure you have a way of stopping him from attacking?"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2C_13,"You know what, you are starting to look like a professional!"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2C_14,"Disarm is a pretty powerful ability isn’t it, and combined with an Initiative of 10 makes Provoking Roar a really good card to get you out of nasty scrapes."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2C_15,Time for a new test!
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2D_01,"Until now, characters have always drawn a +0 Attack Modifier meaning their attacks have dealt the exact damage value specified on the cards. But that is not how Gloomhaven works…"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2D_02,In Gloomhaven every attacking character draws an Attack Modifier which influences the damage dealt: +1 +2 *2 or -1 -2 *0. You can see these modifiers by hovering over any character.
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2D_03,These 2 Archers have 2 Attack Modifiers remaining in their decks: *2 and *0. We want them to draw the *0 and to do that we need to give them Disadvantage.
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2D_04,Ranged Attacks have Disadvantage when their target is on an adjacent hex: forcing them to draw 2 modifiers cards and choosing the worst result.
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2D_05,Let’s attack one Archer with a Ranged Attack and stand next to the other one to give them Disadvantage.
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2D_06,"Ouch! That was one very powerful Attack! Try again, this time, go stand next to one Archer and attack the other."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2D_07,"Did you see her draw the x2 and the x0? Ha, that showed her!"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2D_08,"Also, your Spare Dagger drew a +1 meaning you did 4 damage total killing them."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2D_09,"Time to kill the last Archer and loot that Chest over there, looking at your Attack Modifier Deck it seems to be mainly +1s, so you should be lucky again."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2D_10,"You need to go early enough to get the first Attack in, but do 4 Damage to her."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2D_11,"You managed 3+1 Damage last time, it should work again, just make sure you don’t have Disadvantage when you Attack!"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2D_12,"We are going to need what is in that Chest in the next mission, make sure you have Looted it."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2D_13,"Ah, a Heater Shield, that’s going to help!"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_2D_14,"You’ve finished the basic missions now, time to introduce character specific tactics and get you to start exploring!"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_3A_01,"It’s time to start looking at more specific <b>Abilities</b> and although you’ve used many of his more basic abilities, the <b>Brute</b> has some other weapons in his arsenal."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_3A_02,"In this situation we see two <b>Elite Living Bones</b>, and if you hover over them, you’ll see they are now <b>Level 1</b> enemies and therefore have upgraded statistics."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_3A_03,"In this case, they both have a <b>Shield 1</b> value indicated by the <sprite name=Shield> icon, which prevents 1 damage from incoming <b>Attacks</b>, although it is ignored when targeted with a <b>Pierce Attack</b>."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_3A_04,"As you are so low on cards, it is best to avoid burning any cards at all, so try to kill a <b>Living Bones</b> and survive this round."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_3A_05,"I forgot to mention, the <b>Living Bones</b> sometimes draw an ability that lets them use ALL their <b>Targets</b> on the same enemy. You need to get a <b>Shield</b> up to prevent some of the damage!"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_3A_06,I’d also advise using your <b>Healing Potion</b>during your turn.
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_3A_07,Running away isn’t going to help you win. Get back in there and smash ‘em in the face!
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_3A_08,"You killed the <b>Living Bones</b>, which is great, but as you <b>Burned</b> a card, you don’t have enough cards left to survive round 2. Remember to use the <b>Potion</b> and a <b>Shield</b> ability."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_3A_09,"Well, that attack was pretty brutal, but as you can see <b>Shield</b> abilities prevent damage from every attack that round, so it’s great vs multiple attacks."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_3A_10,"Just one new objective left, ‘simply’ kill the remaining <b>Living Bones</b>, yeah, he’s got quite a lot of Health!"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_3A_11,"The advice here is to get acquainted with the <b>Push</b> ability, all I’ll say is that it goes great with <b>Traps</b> as <b>Shield</b> only prevents <b>Attack Damage</b>."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_3A_12,"He’s not acting too fast this round, so you should be able to <b>Push</b> him onto those <b>Traps</b> before he gets a chance to kill you!"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_3A_13,Remember to do a <b>Short Rest</b> and get <b>Warding Strength</b> back to <b>Push</b> your enemy across the <b>Traps</b>.
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_3A_14,Brilliant work. The <b>Brute</b> has realised that maybe it’s best if he works with other mercenaries and you have convinced him of your tactical prowess.
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_3A_15,<b>The Brute is now available to be used in future open Missions.</b>
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_3B_01,"It’s time to bring in our second mercenary, the Scoundrel. She is great at acting fast, incredibly mobile and able to combo off huge amounts of melee damage"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_3B_02,"For this mission however, you’ll need to take down the three enemy Archers in a single turn. You’ll certainly need to use her multiple Target attack plus work out how to kill the third Archer."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_3B_03,"It seems you didn’t act soon enough. The Scoundrel has some very low value Initiative abilities, so this shouldn’t be a problem."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_3B_04,The abilities you’ll need to kill all three are a combination of Throwing Knives and Smoke Bomb. Make sure you work out which enemies to target with which abilities!
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_3B_05,Feels good picking off different targets at the same time doesn’t it? Your final objective is to scoop up at least 5 piles of Gold in this last turn.
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_3B_06,"You should be aware that the Loot Ability picks up ALL Gold within the ability’s radius, so work out where you need to be and go Looting!"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_3B_07,"You may need to Move before Looting, and not all Move abilities are on the bottom half of Ability Cards!"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_3B_08,"Right, let me take care of that gold for you…"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_3B_09,Now we’ve got two mercs in our Guild it’s time to take on our first actual mission.
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_4A_01,"Right, this is your first proper fight. There are two clearings with a couple of Bandits each."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_4A_02,"Remember what I’ve taught you, and don’t enter the second clearing until you are ready, but also ensure you have enough abilities left when you decide to venture forth!"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_5A_01,"Say hello to the Spellweaver, a powerful but fragile magician who can harness the natural Elements of the world. She’s in a bit of a pickle right now though!"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_5A_02,"The Elemental Display on the right of the screen indicates the magical Elements available for spellcasting, at the moment an Ice Element is available."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_5A_03,You should empower her Freezing Nova to do extra damage and then get away from the surrounding Bandits this turn.
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_5A_04,"You need to get away from the Bandits after hitting them, use Ride The Wind."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_5A_05,To power up Freezing Nova you need to Consume the Ice Element before using it. Make sure you click on the Element Symbol before choosing to use that half of the Ability Card.
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_5A_06,"That Infused spell did a base 3 damage instead of 2, meaning you knocked out three Bandits instead of one plus the Immobilize condition meant the Bandits couldn’t come after you."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_5A_07,"The Ride The Wind also created a handy Air Element for you to use but with only 3 Unburned cards, the Spellweaver will be dead in a turn!"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_5A_08,"Fortunately, she has a very powerful trick up her sleeve. The top half of Reviving Ether allows her to return ALL of her Burned cards to her hand!"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_5A_09,"It’s up to you now, defeat the last 3 Bandit Guards!"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_5A_10,"As you can see, the Spellweaver is great at turning around a bad situation, but she’s not a great starting character due to the complexity of her tactics!"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_5A_11,Have another go at using her abilities. Remember to Consume Elements to power up Abilities and don’t get caught in Disadvantage by shooting in Melee range!
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_5B_01,"Here’s the Tinkerer, he’s a great Support character to have in a team, but also can take on multiple enemies in a pinch"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_5B_02,"Currently he is Wounded and will take 1 Damage at the start of every turn, so you need to Heal him as soon as possible"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_5B_03,"Also, he has access to an Area Effect Attack, see if you can use it to Attack all the enemies and kill the Elite in one turn!"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_5B_04,"Remember to use Items when in a pinch, it’s not just the Abilities that you have at your disposal!"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_5B_05,"Sometimes it is better to wait for the bad guys to come to you, try picking Ink Bomb first and then Toxic Bolt to get them all in Range before the Tinkerer’s turn starts."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_5B_06,"You may have noticed that if you use a Heal ability when Wounded, the character gains no Health, but loses the condition, the same is true of Poison."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_5B_07,Ink Bomb was pretty good eh? You can rotate the Area of Effect with the < & > keys.
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_5B_08,I’ll leave you to finish off the rest of the bad guys.
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_5B_09,"Remember when enemies are nearby to try and go first, the Net Shooter should be able to finish them off."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_5B_10,Not so bad for a little guy eh? I think it’s time we looked at starting to get some money coming in.
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_5C_01,"The crypt is bathed in an unholy light from the portals in the corners of the room, you prepare yourselves for battle."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_5C_02,"The Portals suddenly blink out of existence and the Undead fall to the floor, it seems as though you have survived the Undead onslaught."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_6A_01,"Hounds burst from the undergrowth and soon after them a Scout commanding them, he seems surprised to have come upon a small band of mercenaries, make him pay!"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_6A_02,"This clearing opens onto a small Vermling Camp, if you clear this, the road onwards should be clear."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_7A_01,"And now we have everyone’s favourite walking boulder, the Cragheart. He is badly outnumbered here, so it is time to explain Retaliate."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_7A_02,"This Condition deals Damage to Melee attackers once they have attacked. It usually lasts a turn, but the Cragheart’s Opposing Strike is an Active Ability which means it lasts multiple turns."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_7A_03,"My gut tells me these <b>Living Bones</b> have a trick or two up their sleeve, so I suggest you smash two before they can act and then see Retaliate do it’s work!"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_7A_04,"Avalanche is a very powerful attack, and you have an available Earth Element, remember to use it!
"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_7A_05,Avalanche can pick off two of the blighters and then activating Opposing Strike will take out any others stupid enough to attack you.
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_7A_06,"Oof, took a bit of damage, but that was a great result, and look, the Opposing Strike still has 2 activations left."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_7A_07,"You may have also noticed that the <b>Living Bones</b>’ Shield didn’t prevent any Retaliate Damage? Well, Shield only prevents Attack Damage and Retaliate isn’t an Attack."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_7A_08,"Right, finish them off and we’ll get out of here."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_7A_09,"You still have two <b>Retaliate</b> activations on <b>Opposing Strike</b>, so only need to do 2 Damage to the remaining <b>Living Bones</b>, plus the bottom of Rumbling Advance can deal 1 Damage through their Shields."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_7A_10,"That’s five mercenaries recruited, we need to get just one more."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_7B_01,"Meet the final member of your starting roster, the Mindthief. She may be small, but with her ability to control the actions of enemies and summon allies, she is a force to be reckoned with."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_7B_02,"I also think it is time for you to face a more serious enemy, the Night Demon. These guys have an inherent ability to give Disadvantage to all attackers, so try and kill them without attacking if you can."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_7B_03,"For the first turn, summon an Ally and kill a Night Demon, be aware, they move very fast!"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_7B_04,"Use Gnawing Horde to summon your rattish ally, they can help you fight the Demons."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_7B_05,"Although your Push ability is in the Burned pile, you can use Parasitic Influence to force an enemy to move onto a Trap."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_7B_06,"I think you are skilled enough to banish these Demons with your Ally. The good news is that if you are at the same range, enemies will prioritise attacking your Rat."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_7B_07,"The Mindthief also has access to Augment abilities such as Withering Claw. These are Permanent buffs to her melee attacks, but she can usually only have one active at a time."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_7B_08,"I’ll leave you to it, Good Luck!"
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_7B_09,"With both Fearsome Blade & Parasitic Edge in the Discard Pile, you can certainly use another trap to kill a Night Demon, while combining attacks with your Ally against the other one."
SCENARIO_PUZZLE_7B_10,Great work! You can now consider yourself a Demon-Slayer!
SCENARIO_STORY_BRUTE_1_ROOM_3,"You push through to a clearing in the forest and are surprised to see Inox in charge of the hounds, they wear the markings of a traitor from your tribe, this is no random attack!"
SCENARIO_STORY_BRUTE_1_START_1,"Hounds come crashing out of the woods and you step forwards to protect Scabwit, but he is having none of it, ‘I can defend myself just fine, you know!’
You aren’t sure of that, you’d better keep him alive if you want to get paid!"
SCENARIO_STORY_BRUTE_1_SUCCESS_1,"With the hounds and Inox dead, you walk over to a body, you were right, the markings are similar to those of the old chief’s bodyguard who killed him in his sleep and took his axe."
SCENARIO_STORY_BRUTE_2_START_1,"My scouts are reporting Inox Warriors with humans flooding through the forest, they are heading right towards us, so expect heavy resistance."
SCENARIO_STORY_BRUTE_2_START_2,"We’ll make a stand here, if we take down enough of them, they should rout, my tribemates will help."
SCENARIO_STORY_BRUTE_2_SUCCESS_1,"Faced with the solid resolve, the attackers turn tail and flee back into the forest, it looks like you have won!"
SCENARIO_STORY_SCOUNDREL_1_START_1,"The night is foggy and cold and you have been waiting on that mossy stump for what seems to be hours. Your fingers and toes start to feel numb, but your ears do not: a twig cracks on your left, and out of the gloom come a small group of Bandits, this was...unexpected."
SCENARIO_STORY_SCOUNDREL_1_START_2,"Sorry Luv, the boss has decided you know a bit too much of his grand plan, and well, we’ve been brought in to tie up a few loose ends."
SCENARIO_STORY_SCOUNDREL_1_START_3,"Mind you, he’s paid us your wages, luckily our job is going to be nice and easy..."
SCENARIO_STORY_SCOUNDREL_1_SUCCESS_1,"It seems your would-be assassins weren’t lying, they are carrying enough money to cover your original payment."
SCENARIO_STORY_SCOUNDREL_1_SUCCESS_2,"That is kind of irrelevant now, no one double crosses you, first it’s just plain rude, and secondly, it’s bad for business, and no one messes with your business."
SCENARIO_STORY_SCOUNDREL_2_START_1,"You charge into the campsite, the gathered Inox turn to fight, but they will take a while to react."
SCENARIO_STORY_SCOUNDREL_2_SUCCESS_1,"The Inox army is now but scattered to the winds. You could easily walk away with their spoils and see justice in that, but you are a woman of principles. The coward has apparently sealed himself in the inner chambers with a supply of food, you’ll have to find another way in, and you’ll need some help!"
SCENARIO_STORY_SCOUNDREL_3_ROOM_2,"As you open the final door, you expect to see your adversary, but apart from even more Inox, he is nowhere to be found!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_BLOODFORD_ROOM_2,"The Stench is even worse in here, the Corpses in here are larger and look even more corpulent!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_BLOODFORD_START_1,"Well this stench can only mean one thing, Living Corpses! They are big and hit hard, but boy are they slow."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_BLOODFORD_START_2,Keep on your toes and hit them from range and you should be fine.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_BLOODFORD_SUCCESS,The last of the Undead falls to the floor and the curse on this place is lifted. 
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_DEMONSPINEHOLLOW_START_1,"As you pass through a clearing, hounds burst out of the undergrowth followed by high pitched laughing, it seems the villagers were right!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_DEMONSPINEHOLLOW_START_2,Imps! We never believed the elders of my clan when they said they used to deal with fairies.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_DEMONSPINEHOLLOW_START_3,"The world must be in dire straights if they have become this brazen, beware their magic, an Imp’s curse is not to be taken lightly!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_DEMONSPINEHOLLOW_SUCCESS,"With the Imps and Hounds dead, the colours of the forest return to normal and you head on towards the village."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SAHMYRT_START_1,You reach the village and are surprised to see some Vermlings wielding staffs as well as the usual bows and arrows. Perhaps this battle may be more dangerous than you first thought
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SAHMYRT_START_2,"Watch out for the shamans, They can curse your whole party and heal their allies, if you can, take them down fast!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SAHMYRT_SUCCESS,"The main area around the trade route is now clear, although many Vermlings have retreated into deeper parts of the forest."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SHADEREST_START_1,"Ah, Cultists. They may look relatively harmless at first glance, but you need to eliminate them as soon as possible as they have the ability to raise the undead."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SHADEREST_START_2,"That said, if mortally wounded they can die in the process!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SHADEREST_START_3,"Also, be aware that due to the powerful energies they are invoking, they sometimes have a tendency to explode when killed, so depending on how volatile they are looking, maybe stand back?"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SHADEREST_SUCCESS,"This branch of the Cult is no more, but they are still active in other parts of the realm so this is n’t the last you’ll see of them!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SOUTHSHIELD_START_1,"A motley group of Vermlings and Inox burst out of the undergrowth, you can hear more in the distance, prepare for a large attack!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SOUTHSHIELD_START_2,"This is a rag-tag bunch of enemies. Although there are a lot of them, survive for long enough and they’ll likely lose heart."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_SOUTHSHIELD_SUCCESS,"As another enemy falls, the remaining adversaries turn tail and flee, their morale broken. You consider giving chase, but the forest is too dense and getting lost is a definite possibility."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THEBARRENCOAST_START_1,"As expected, out of the bushes stomp some very angry looking Inox, you try to communicate with them, but to no avail, they prepare to attack."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THEBARRENCOAST_START_2,"It seems some of my less cultured cousins are going to mess with your day. Treat Inox as big angry humans, they aren’t too difficult to take down unless they bring their Shamen along."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THEBARRENCOAST_SUCCESS,"With the tribe defeated, your path from the forest is no longer barred, you continue to the Barren Coast."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THECITYOFSLATE_START_1,"Well, this is new to me, Undead with flaming bows?"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THECITYOFSLATE_START_2,"It looks as if their arrow heads may be explosive, try and split up if possible!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THECITYOFSLATE_SUCCESS,"It seems they return to the dust like any other Undead, now let’s see what the archaeologists can reward us with!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THECOPPEROASIS_START_1,"The Vermlings have made a simple camp here, the Oasis is littered with their rubbish, as you step into view, they grab their weapons and attack."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THECOPPEROASIS_SUCCESS,"With the last Vermling dead, the Oasis is a safe place for travellers once more."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THEPYRE_START_1,"Oh dear, you have awoken some Living Spirits, souls of those who died suddenly and unhappily."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THEPYRE_START_2,Isn’t all death unhappy?
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THEPYRE_START_3,"… This is a Survival Mission. Enemies will keep spawning, you’ll need to survive until Sunrise in 6 turns. Be aware, they’ll keep coming!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THEPYRE_SUCCESS,"As the sun rises, the undead fall to the ground and you leave the tomb and its terrors. You then pile up stones over the entrance, so that no one else awakens the restless dead."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THESLOSHEDSQUIRREL_START_1,"What the… Bandits working with Vermlings? These guys are going to have a lot of ranged attacks, best get up close and personal!"
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_THESLOSHEDSQUIRREL_SUCCESS,"As the last bow falls to the ground, you patch your wounds and head off towards the pub."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_WAYFARERSREST_START_1,This is a Bounty mission which means to succeed you will need to kill a certain number of enemies.
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_WAYFARERSREST_START_2,"The good news is that the whole battle will take place in this single clearing, the bad news is that enemies will keep spawning until you kill enough."
SCENARIO_TRAVEL_WAYFARERSREST_SUCCESS,"Good Job, i don’t think they’ll be coming back in a hurry!"

TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_001,"So, you want to learn how to run your own mercenary guild, eh? Well, let’s begin some basic training - there’s no one better than the Brute to help with that!"
TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_002_1,"Before we get to the action, you’ll want to acquaint yourself with how to adjust your view of the battlefield, so let’s go over the camera controls:"

You can also rotate the camera by dragging your mouse with the middle mouse button held.</color>

</color>Try them out now and press Continue when you're ready to move on."
TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_003,"In <color=#f5e3b0><b>Gloomhaven</b></color>, you control a party of mercenaries, each equipped with a deck of <b>Ability Cards</b>. These cards are how your mercenaries will explore dungeons, fight enemies and loot treasure.

At the beginning of each round, the first thing to do is select two cards for each mercenary to use on their turn."
TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_004,"In this tutorial, the Brute has just three cards at his disposal, as you can see highlighted on the left: <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Grab and Go</color></font></b></nobr>, <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Trample</color></font></b></nobr> and <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Provoking Roar</color></font></b></nobr>.

<nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Provoking Roar</color></font></b></nobr> is greyed to indicate that it is currently discarded, so for now let's just select the two cards the Brute has available."
TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_005,"See the number next to the Brute's portrait at the top of the screen? This shows his <b>initiative</b>. 

The number next to first card you select determines the character's <b>initiative</b> for the round. The lower the number, the earlier in the round the character will act."
TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_006,"Since there are no other characters visible right now, it will immediately be the Brute's turn anyhow."
TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_007_1,"Now it is the Brute's turn, time to choose some <b>actions</b>. Each half of a card represents an <b>action</b>, comprised of one or more <b>abilities</b>."
TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_007_2,"You get to use two <b>actions</b> per turn, and you can pick any of the four card halves on the left to use as your first <b>action</b> - but note that you must then use the opposite side of the other card for your second."
TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_007_3,"For example, here you can choose either the top half of <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Trample</color></font></b></nobr> and the bottom half of <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Grab and Go</color></font></b></nobr>..."
TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_007_4,...or the bottom half of <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Trample</color></font></b></nobr> and the top half of <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Grab and Go</color></font></b></nobr>.
TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_007_5,"There's nothing for the Brute to do in this room, so you'll want to proceed through the door to see what lies beyond with a <b>Move</b> ability. 

<nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Grab and Go</color></font></b>'s</nobr> bottom half lets the Brute move four hexes, which is enough to get through the door. Let's use that!"
TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_010,"This room contains your first enemy, a Bandit Guard! Like player characters, monsters also select actions for their turn - let's find out what this Bandit is planning to do before we do anything else."
TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_011_1,"Looks like the Bandit is planning to <b>Move</b> and <b>Attack</b> this round, unless the Brute can kill him first!

While player characters get two <b>actions</b> per turn, monsters only get one - albeit often with multiple <b>abilities</b> within."
TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_011_2,"Notice how this Bandit has a lower <b>initiative</b> than the Brute, and would normally have gone first. 

As it is currently the Brute’s turn however, you'll get to finish his turn before the Bandit can act. "
TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_011_3,Let's get the Brute close enough to use the <b>Attack</b> on <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Trample</color></font></b>'s</nobr> top half as the second action for the turn!
TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_012,"Now that you've finished using <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Grab and Go</color></font></b></nobr> for the turn, it is <b>discarded</b> and no longer usable until you return it to hand via resting - more on that later.

For now, time to attack!"
TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_015_1,"Every attack you make draws an attack modifier from your modifier deck and that value is applied to your attack.

In this case you can see above the Bandit Guard that a <b><color=#FFA414>+0</color></b> modifier was drawn, so your attack still just deals its base value of <b>3</b> damage."
TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_015_2,"For this tutorial, we will only have <b><color=#FFA414>+0</color></b> modifiers in effect to keep things simple. We'll explore the other attack modifiers later!"
TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_016_1,"Now it is the Bandit’s turn. As we saw on his card earlier, he intends to <b>Move</b> and then perform a melee <b>Attack</b> for 3 damage. 

However, as he is already within melee range of the Brute, he will simply forgo the <b>Move</b> and get straight to the <b>Attack</b>."
TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_016_2,"Ouch! While monsters always take damage directly to their health points, whenever a player character is damaged, you are presented with three options:"
TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_016_3,"Firstly, you can simply take the damage to your health point total. However, if this is reduced to 0, this character is <b>exhausted</b>, which means they can no longer act in this scenario.

If all of your mercenaries are <b>exhausted</b>, you will lose the scenario!"
TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_016_4,"Secondly, you can choose to <b>burn</b> two discarded ability cards instead of receiving the damage. If you <b>burn</b> a card it can no longer be recovered by resting. "
TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_016_5,"However, if you were to <b>burn</b> two of Brute's cards here, he would not have enough cards left for the following turn, and thus would be <b>exhausted</b>!"
TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_016_6,"Finally, you can choose to <b>burn</b> one <b>available</b> card. This option is greyed out as all of the Brute's cards are currently <b>discarded</b>."
TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_016_7,"It is usually wise to take the damage over burning cards if possible, lest you run out of cards to finish the scenario with!

For now, let's opt to just take the three damage, as the Brute has enough health to survive."
TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_017,"The Bandit’s turn is now over. As he was the last character to act, it is the end of the round, and a new round begins."
TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_018_1,"During ability card selection, if you have at least two discarded cards then you may perform a <b>Long</b> or <b>Short Rest</b> to recover some of them.

All of the Brute's ability cards are currently discarded (<b>Long Rest</b> doesn't count as a card) and as such he will have to rest to continue."
TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_018_2,"<b>Short Rest</b> will burn one of your discarded cards at random, losing it for the rest of the scenario, but will recover all other discarded cards before continuing your turn as normal - so you can recover cards to use immediately in this very turn."
TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_018_3,"<b>Long Rest</b> takes up the whole turn, and is used instead of selecting two ability cards, giving the character an initiative of <b>99</b>. However, you not only get to choose which card to burn instead of it being at random, but the character will perform a ""<b>Heal 2</b>"" action and refresh all item cards!"
TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_018_4,"Choosing to <b>Long Rest</b> here would be certain death if the Bandit draws an attack card for the round, as the Brute has neither health nor cards to spare, so let's choose to <b>Short Rest</b>."
TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_019,"<nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Grab and Go</color></font></b></nobr> has been randomly selected as the card to burn.

Once per short rest you can opt to redraw the random card to burn at the cost of one damage, but with the Brute only on 1 health, this isn’t an option!"
TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_020_1,You can see <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Grab and Go</color></font></b></nobr> is now dark red to indicate it is burned and no longer usable in the current scenario.
TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_020_2,"In exchange, <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Trample</color></font></b></nobr> and <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Provoking Roar</color></font></b></nobr> have been returned to hand and are available to use again!"
TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_020_3,"Both the Brute and the Bandit are near-death, so it is crucial to go as early as possible in the round to get the first attack!

Remember, the first card you choose determines the Brute’s initiative, so let's choose <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Provoking Roar</color></font></b></nobr> to maximise the chance Brute is up first with a low initiative of <b>10</b>."
TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_022_1,"Now that we are in the same room as the Bandit, we can see that enemies draw their ability cards each round after the player(s), so you won't know what they'll be doing or what their initiatives will be until this point in each round."
TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_022_2,"It looks as if this guy was planning on shielding himself and retaliating, but because you chose to act quickly with an initiative of <b>10</b>, he won't have those active until after the Brute's turn due to a slower initiative of <b>15</b>! Let's get him!"
TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_024_1,"Got him! Do you see that gold on the floor that the Bandit left behind? To pick it up, you need to use a <b>Loot</b> ability. 

One important rule of <color=#f5e3b0><b>Gloomhaven</b></color> to bear in mind is that you don’t automatically loot treasure - if you want it, you'll have to pick it up before the scenario ends!"
TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_024_2,"<b>Loot</b> abilities can appear on ability cards, but often the easiest way to collect it is to end your turn on a hex that contains a gold pile.

So, let's move the Brute onto the gold before the end of his turn with his remaining action!"
TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_024_3,"But, wait... look at <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Provoking Roar</color></font></b></nobr>.

It doesn't have a <b>Move</b> ability on the bottom half's action, so how can the Brute <b>Move</b> onto the gold?"
TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_024_4,"This is where <b>default actions</b> come in handy! To the left and right of the central initiative value are two small <b>default action</b> buttons.

These allow the character to perform a melee <b>Attack</b> for <b>2</b> instead of the top action or a default <b>Move</b> of <b>2</b> instead of the bottom action."
TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_025_1,"Great work! Not only did you vanquish the, err... lone Bandit Guard, you’ve even managed to pick up a few pieces of gold!"
TUTORIAL_2_TEXT_025_2,"That’s the basics covered, time to introduce you to some slightly more dangerous scenarios..."

Tutorial_1_TextBox_001a,"It was supposed to be an easy job; track the bandits to their lair, sneak inside, grab any loot and get out sharpish.

It's unclear exactly when it all went wrong - perhaps it was the Cragheart smashing the entrance open loudly with his fists, or the Brute ramming a Bandit Guard's face into a wall to stifle his attempts at alerting the others..."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_001b,"Split up from the Cragheart after fighting through hordes of bandits, the Brute finds his way into a disused storeroom and hunkers down, trying to get his breath back."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_001c,"Suddenly the door at the other end of the room swings open...

""Well, well, well, what do we have here then?"""
Tutorial_1_TextBox_001d,"It looks like the Brute is going to have to fight his way out of here.

In Gloomhaven, the first thing you do each round is to pick two <b>ability cards</b> for characters to use on their turn.

Since the Brute needs to get across the room to deal with this Bandit Guard, you'll need to select a card that lets you move at least four hexes, and a card with an attack to try and take this Guard down."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_001e,"You can look through your cards by mousing over them in the list on the left - <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Provoking Roar</color></font></b></nobr> and <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Grab and Go</color></font></b></nobr> are the only ones you currently have available but should get the job done nicely.

Note that the first card you select will also set your initiative for the round - the lower the number the earlier in the round the character will act, so choose <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Provoking Roar</color></font></b></nobr> first to go early here."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_002a,"Enemies draw their ability cards each round after the player, so you don't know what they'll be doing or what their initiatives will be until this point in each round.

It looks as if this guy was planning on shielding himself and retaliating, but because you chose to act quickly with an initiative of <b>10</b>, he won't have those active until after the Brute's turn due to his slower initiative of <b>15</b>!"
Tutorial_1_TextBox_003a,"Now it is time to act. Each half of a card represents an <b>action</b>, comprised of one or more <b>abilities</b>.

You get to use two actions per turn, and you can pick any of the four card halves on the left to use as your first action - but note that you must then use the opposite side of the other card for your second action."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_003b,"In other words, here you can choose either the top half of <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Provoking Roar</color></font></b></nobr> and the bottom half of <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Grab and Go</color></font></b></nobr>..."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_003c,...or the bottom half of <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Provoking Roar</color></font></b></nobr> and the top half of <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Grab and Go</color></font></b></nobr>.
Tutorial_1_TextBox_003d,"Now, as the Bandit Guard is on the other side of the room, let's choose the bottom half of <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Grab and Go</color></font></b></nobr> and get over there!"
Tutorial_1_TextBox_004a,"Do you see how <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Grab and Go</color></font></b></nobr> has become all grey and smoky? This is to show you that <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Grab and Go</color></font></b></nobr> has been discarded, now that you have used one of its actions.

This means that you can't use it again until you recover it back to your hand - more on that later."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_004b,"The Brute is up close and personal with the Bandit Guard now, so it's time to give him a taste of your steel. Hit him with the top half of <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Provoking Roar</color></font></b></nobr>!"
Tutorial_1_TextBox_005a,"Every attack you make draws an attack modifier from your modifier deck and that value is applied to your attack.

In this case you can see above the Bandit Guard that you drew a <b><color=#FFA414>+1</color></b>, so that makes <b>2</b> from <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Provoking Roar</color></font></b></nobr>, plus <b>1</b> from the attack modifier, thus dealing a total of <b>3</b> damage. Bosh!"
Tutorial_1_TextBox_005b,Nicely done! You can hover over the crossed swords icon to the left of your ability cards to see what attack modifiers you have left. Let's do so now.
Tutorial_1_TextBox_006a,"While mousing over this icon, you can see how many of each of the seven base attack modifier card types there are in your deck.

Each modifier value has a number of filled in or greyed out pips below to indicate how many of that modifier are still left and discarded respectively.

Whenever you draw a <b><color=#A050E0>x0</color></b> or <b><color=#D92727>x2</color></b> modifier, the modifier deck will shuffle the discarded cards back in."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_006b,"By the way, do you see that gold on the floor that the bandit left behind? To pick it up, you need to perform a Loot action. These can appear on an ability card with a number indicating the radius around you that you loot."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_006c,"However, if a player character ends their turn on gold or a chest, they will loot that hex for free.

Perhaps you will get some gold out of this escapade after all, if these Bandits don't kill you first..."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_006d,"One last thing before moving on to the next round - throughout this tutorial you'll notice that the camera moves to focus on the action. You too can move the camera around using the following controls:

<b>W A S D</b> - Pan camera
<line-height=20%>
<line-height=100%><b>Q E</b> - Rotate camera left/right
<line-height=20%>
<line-height=100%><b>Mousewheel Up/Down</b> - Zoom camera in/out

You can also rotate the camera by dragging your mouse with the middle mouse button held."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_006e,"Nothing left to do now but end the Brute's turn and get onto the next round!

Use the button below to do so."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_007a,"Right, back to the matter of getting out of here!

The Brute is looking a little worse for wear, and with no monsters in the current room, now is a good time to rest and get some energy back - or rather, some cards."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_007b,"During ability card selection, if you have at least two discarded cards then you may perform a Long or Short Rest to recover some of them.

All of the Brute's ability cards are currently discarded (Long Rest doesn't count as a card) and as such he will have to rest to continue."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_007c,"Short Rest will burn one of your discarded cards at random, losing it for the rest of the scenario, but will recover all other discarded cards before continuing your turn as normal - so you can recover cards to use immediately in this very turn."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_007d,"Long Rest takes up the whole turn, and is used instead of selecting two ability cards, giving the character an initiative of <b>99</b>. However, you not only get to choose which card to burn instead of it being at random, but the character will perform a ""<b>Heal 2</b>"" action and refresh all item cards!

Doing that in the midst of enemies tends to be a risky move, but with no enemies in here right now let's have the Brute go for a nice Long Rest."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_008a,"Time to choose a card to lose, which is never an easy choice. <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Grab and Go</color></font></b></nobr> may look weak, but the mobility it offers could be important. For now let's just burn <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Leaping Cleave</color></font></b></nobr>."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_009a,"One of the most important tactical moments when exploring dungeons is when to open doors.

When a door is opened, all enemies in the next room are immediately added to the initiative track and will act this round! You do get to finish the current character's turn however, even if an enemy with lower initiative is revealed."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_009b,"With that in mind, you'll want to look carefully through the cards available to you to see what your options are. You can hold down the <b>Alt</b> key to see the current character's full hand of cards all at once to assist with decision making during card selection. Feel free to try this now before clicking Continue."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_009c,"In this scenario, let's choose <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Spare Dagger</color></font></b></nobr> and <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Grab and Go</color></font></b></nobr>.

We can open the door using <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Grab and Go</color></font></b></nobr>'s bottom half, move to safety with the remaining move points and hopefully be in range to throw a <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Spare Dagger</color></font></b></nobr> at any nearby enemies!"
Tutorial_1_TextBox_010a,Select the bottom half of <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Grab and Go</color></font></b></nobr> and let's see what is on the other side of that doorway!
Tutorial_1_TextBox_011a,"What a surprise, more bad guys! Before doing anything else, let's check out what these enemies are doing this turn by either hovering over their portraits or the figures themselves.

Lets start with the Bandit Archer."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_011b,"Just a ranged attack planned from the Archer, no moving - good to know.

Let's look at the Bandit Guard now."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_011c,"The Guard intends to move and attack, but he will only be able to move a single hex.

Now that we know what the enemy is up to, we can make informed decisions about how best to finish the remainder of the Brute's turn."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_011d,"Your best bet is to get the Brute out of range of the Guard's move whilst getting as close to the Archer as possible.

She doesn't have a move this turn so if we move the Brute next to her, she will have to ranged attack from an adjacent hex and incur <color=#A050E0>Disadvantage</color> - meaning she'll draw two attack modifiers and apply the worst one!"
Tutorial_1_TextBox_011e,"From there the Bandit Guard will still be in range to be hit by <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Spare Dagger</color></font></b></nobr>'s top half, yet unable to reach the Brute to attack back this round.

 This plan should minimise the amount of damage the Brute takes this round whilst still getting a good amount of damage in. Let's do it!"
Tutorial_1_TextBox_012a,"Ranged attacks allow you to hit enemies further than one hex away, but as mentioned when entering the room, you will incur <color=#A050E0>Disadvantage</color> if you try to use a ranged attack on an adjacent enemy.

As you can see, the Archer now has a flashing <color=#A050E0>Disadvantage</color> icon to indicate this and the attack preview above her head is in purple."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_012b,"Since the Bandit Guard isn't adjacent to the Brute, lets throw the Spare Dagger at him!"
Tutorial_1_TextBox_013a,"Ha ha! See that? If you had attacked the Archer, the critical hit <b><color=#D92727>x2</color></b> modifier would have been discarded! Not that we knew, mind you, but minimising such eventualities is a good way to play."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_014a,"Phew, that could have been nasty; she very nearly dealt you <b>5</b> damage instead of just <b>1</b>! You can see why trying to give ranged enemies disadvantage when you can is a good strategy.

However, if a enemy with a ranged attack has movement before the attack on their turn, they will back away if possible first."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_014b,"Unfortunately though, one damage still got through.

When damaged, you choose to either lose that much health, burn one available card or two discarded cards. It's usually best to only burn cards when it is very high damage or if you really have to, so for now let's just have the Brute take one damage."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_015a,Just the Archer left in here now. Let's go early and play a nice little trick on her using that handy trap on the floor...
Tutorial_1_TextBox_015b,Looks like she's planning to move and attack this round - if she even gets a turn!
Tutorial_1_TextBox_016a,"Use <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Provoking Roar</color></font></b></nobr>'s disarming attack on her first - that'll both weaken her and will prevent any attacks back should the rest of the plan go awry!

Even if the drawn attack modifier causes no damage to be dealt, she will still gain the Disarmed condition and be unable to attack the Brute back."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_017a,Another great hit - now let's move closer to the door and give her a nudge onto that rusty old trap!
Tutorial_1_TextBox_017b,"Ouch, that's gotta hurt!

Through careful positioning and planning you can often find creative lines like that one to beat the odds, even when seemingly outnumbered."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_018a,"Time to check out the next room, but the Brute has no available cards remaining! Let's Long Rest again to get some cards back."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_019a,"Let's burn <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Provoking Roar</color></font></b></nobr> as its bottom half is of no use to us right now, and the top half is comparable to some of our other cards.

Worth noting now that with the Brute's card pool diminishing, if a character ends their turn with fewer than two playable cards and fewer than two discarded cards, they will be exhausted and unable to act - no matter how much health they have left! If all of your characters become exhausted, it's game over."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_020a,"Right, let's see what's through this next door. Same tactics as last time; <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Spare Dagger</color></font></b></nobr> and <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Grab and Go</color></font></b></nobr>!"
Tutorial_1_TextBox_021a,"Wow, look at all the treasure in here, and three Bandit Guards too? This ain't gonna be easy...

Hang on, who's that in the corner?"
Tutorial_1_TextBox_021b,"It's the Cragheart! Albeit looking in somewhat rough shape - moreso than usual! With him back in the party we can swiftly dispatch these bandits without issue.

Looks like he's going to be up next, so let's finish the Brute's turn."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_021c,"If you mouse over the Guards you can see they're planning to ""<b>Move 2, Attack 2</b>"". With so few cards left of our own, we need to carefully navigate this last room to avoid exhaustion!

Let's get the Brute over towards the Cragheart and attack the closest Bandit Guard while we're at it."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_022a,"I know what you are thinking... <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Spare Dagger</color></font></b></nobr> is a ranged attack, but the Brute is standing next to the target, and a disadvantaged attack is surely not the most intelligent move?

Well, on each half of a card you can also find <b>default actions</b> for situations just like this."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_022b,"To the left and right of the central initiative value are two small <b>default action</b> buttons. These allow the character to perform a melee attack  for <b>2</b> instead of the top action or a default move of <b>2</b> instead of the bottom action.

They are pretty handy when you are in a situation just like this one! Let's attack the Bandit Guard using the default attack button on <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Spare Dagger</color></font></b></nobr>."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_023a,"Only a <b><color=#FFA414>+0</color></b> this time, but by choosing not to ranged attack from an adjacent hex you didn't incur <color=#A050E0>Disadvantage</color>."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_025a,"Over to the Cragheart now - he already has some cards selected for the turn, so let's see how we can best use them.

It'd be great if we could move up next to that pair of Bandit Guards and hit them both with <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Avalanche</color></font></b></nobr>, but we can't currently reach them with the move abilities available."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_025b,"However, if you look over at the Cragheart's inventory, he is wearing some <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#CCCCCC>Boots of Striding</color></font></b></nobr>. These can grant him two extra hexes of range for a single move!

Let's use them to get close to the two Guards now and ping them for a bit of extra damage while we're at it."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_027a,"Many ability card actions are comprised of multiple abilities and effects. These always play out in order from top to bottom.

For example, the bottom half of the Cragheart's <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Rumbling Advance</color></font></b></nobr> is a move ability, followed by a damage ability, followed by an <color=#78b356>Earth</color> elemental infusion."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_028a,"What are infusions, I hear you ask? If you look at the right-hand side of the screen, the elemental infusions holder can be seen - and it now shows that <color=#78b356>Earth</color> is currently being ""infused"".

This means at the end of this character's turn, it will be available for the remainder of this round and the next for any character, be it player or monster, to ""consume"" in order to augment certain abilities.

Therefore, the character who infuses an element cannot use it that turn, as it is only available after the current turn in this round is over. We'll get onto ""consumes"" in just a moment."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_028b,"Back to the action now, let's hit those bandits with <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Avalanche</color></font></b></nobr>!

<nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Avalanche</color></font></b></nobr>'s top half is an Area Effect attack, as denoted by the hex pattern that shows you its shape. It is a melee Area Effect attack as the shape has a grey hex, representing the hex the Cragheart is on, with the red hexes indicating those that will be attacked.

The shape can be rotated about the Cragheart using the mouse, so you will be able to line up the two hexes to attack with the Bandit Guards."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_029a,"That hit pretty hard!

Did you notice the burn icon in the bottom right corner of <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Avalanche</color></font></b></nobr>'s top half? Actions with this icon burn the card instead of discarding it after use, which means you cannot recover them by normal means such as resting - although certain effects do exist that permit recovery of burned cards.

Using the default action that accompanies an action with a burn icon will discard the card after use as normal however."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_030a,"Now, after you end the Cragheart's turn, it'll be time for the Bandit Guards to take theirs.

As you now have two player-controlled characters, note that monsters target first based on distance and then on initiative, so the Brute and Cragheart are going to face one Guard each here."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_031a,"Uh oh, the Cragheart is in trouble - the damage from this hit would be lethal and exhaust him! In this case you only really have the option of burning one available card as the damage would be lethal!

Bear in mind that when a character runs out of cards, they are exhausted anyway, so be careful not to burn too many cards too quickly. It is generally easier to regain health points than cards!

For now let's choose to burn <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Crushing Grasp</color></font></b></nobr>."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_032a,"You have no choice but for Brute to take the damage here - if you burn either an available card or two discarded cards, he won't have enough cards next turn and would instantly be exhausted!"
Tutorial_1_TextBox_033a,"Once again, the Brute doesn't have enough available cards to even take a turn this round.

He's going to have to rest, but a Long Rest would let the Bandit Guard go first - and likely deal enough damage to wipe out the Brute before he could heal! Let's go for a Short Rest this time."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_034a,"<nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Spare Dagger</color></font></b></nobr> isn't exactly ideal as the randomly selected card to burn as you might really need that extra attack on the bottom half.

However, once per short rest you can opt to redraw the random card to burn at the cost of one damage. Scary though it may seem to do with the Brute only having 2 health left, let's redraw.

We know it will burn <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Grab and Go</color></font></b></nobr> as it is the only other discarded card."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_035a,"Now that the Brute has enough cards to take a turn, select <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Spare Dagger</color></font></b></nobr> first, as it has the lowest initiative. We need to kill the Bandit Guard before he has a chance to act!"
Tutorial_1_TextBox_036a,Now let's switch over to the Cragheart to pick his abilities for the round too.
Tutorial_1_TextBox_037a,"Once again, we want to go as early in the round as possible to hopefully get our turn in before the Bandit Guards, so let's select <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Explosive Punch</color></font></b></nobr> first.

<nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Crater</color></font></b></nobr> and <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Massive Boulder</color></font></b></nobr>'s top halves are fairly similar, but let's pick <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Crater</color></font></b></nobr> just to be safe - we can play around the attack modifiers missing by using <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Crater</color></font></b></nobr>'s push to finish the Guard off on the trap behind him if need be!"
Tutorial_1_TextBox_038a,"Luckily for you, the Bandit Guards have drawn a card with greater initiative, so both the Brute and Cragheart will get to go before them - let's finish them off!"
Tutorial_1_TextBox_039a,"Great job, you've now got an opportunity to grab that chest before the Cragheart hopefully finishes off the last Bandit Guard and the scenario ends.

Select the default move action from <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Spare Dagger</color></font></b></nobr> and move onto the chest - player characters perform a loot at the end of their turns if finishing on a hex containing gold or a chest."
Tutorial_1_TextBox_040a,Nice haul! Perhaps the Cragheart will swap his ill-fitting boots for the War Hammer - they look like they'd fit the Brute better anyhow!
Tutorial_1_TextBox_041a,"<nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Explosive Punch</color></font></b></nobr> was selected mostly for the low initiative; it offers little else in this situation.

However as <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Crater</color></font></b></nobr> has a strong ranged attack, lets use <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Explosive Punch</color></font></b></nobr> to move away slightly to avoid disadvantage - may as well move onto a tile with some gold while we're at it!"
Tutorial_1_TextBox_042a,"Good thing we infused <color=#78b356>Earth</color> last turn, because before using <nobr><b><font=MarcellusAlt SDF><color=#f5e3b0>Crater</color></font></b></nobr> we want to augment it by consuming the infused <color=#78b356>Earth</color> element, thereby adding the push effect to the attack.

That way, even if we miss on the attack modifiers, the Guard will take fatal damage from the trap just like the poor Archer in the room prior!"
Tutorial_1_TextBox_044a,"Well, would you look at that - we drew the <b><color=#A050E0>x0</color></b> modifier! If we hadn't planned ahead with this backup push, the Guard would've survived the turn.

Let's finish him off by pushing him onto the trap!"
Tutorial_1_TextBox_045a,"Nice work! With this lot dead, it's time to end the round and get out of this stinking crypt!"
